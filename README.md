# AI Emotion Detector
This project is a real-time emotion detector powered by AI. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the FER2013 dataset to recognize facial emotions.

## 📌 Features:
- Real-time face detection using OpenCV and Haar Cascade
- Emotion recognition (in English) with a CNN model built using TensorFlow/Keras
- Live camera feed analysis to detect and display emotions
## 🛠️ Technologies Used:
- TensorFlow/Keras – For training the CNN model
- OpenCV – For image capture and face detection
- FER2013 – Dataset used for model training
## 🚀 How to Use:
1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Run the script to start real-time emotion detection
